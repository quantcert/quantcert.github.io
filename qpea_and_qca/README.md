## Documentation

This code is to compare the entanglement variation the quantum phase
estimation and counting algorithms. The programming language used Python.
See file [EXECUTION.md](EXECUTION.md) for execution.

By varying the value of the angle evolved in the algorithms, and with the use of
three invariants (one based on Mermin polynomials, one based on Coefficient
Matrices and the geometric measure of entanglement), we are able to obtain
numerical evaluations of the invariants for the quantum states coming
from the algorithms. More information about this is provided in our article
available on arxiv. This code allows to draw the corresponding figures.

The code documentation can be found [here](doc/build/html).
