## Documentation

The code has been developed to study entanglement in Grover's algorithm and in
the QFT, using Mermin polynomials. The framework used for this project is 
SageMath. See file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for its installation and execution.

In an effort to check properties of quantum algorithms, we focus here on the 
entanglement property, the Grover's quantum search algorithm and the QFT. Our
results are summed up in an article available in arXiv [[BJH+19]](#BJH19). The
present code is a part of the implementation used to support those results.

A peculiar attention has been carried on code readability, so it can be easily
usable. The code documentation can be found 
[in pdf format](doc/build/latex/Mermin-evaluation.pdf) or 
[as a website](doc/build/html). It is generated from the code using 
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org).

A more literal description of the code can be found in the article 
[[BJH+19]](#BJH19).
